The images that were made using Plotly are not visible using the html file and notebook preview.

The images represent detected lines that are grouped into 3 groups:

* red --> speed at most 100

* blue --> speed at most 200

* green --> speed more than 200

The exact speed value is as hover info and can be seen when running the notebook (notebook uses cv2_imshow which is dedicated to Google Collab and is not recognised in normal notebooks).
